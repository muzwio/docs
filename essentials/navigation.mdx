<Tip>
  Caught a player who didn't read the rules carefully? Then why don't you hurry up!
</Tip>

## **There are some rules we have set to prevent this clean thinking from being abused;**

1. The player cannot request a penalty without proof, witnesses are not a substitute for proof.

2. If the player is 1.5 days (36 hours) late in submitting the evidence at the time of requesting a penalty, the evidence will be time-barred and no action will be taken. The player must indicate the date of the evidence when submitting it.

3. If a player claims that a player is questionable and requests to be monitored, he/she has to prove his/her questionable behavior. The authorities refuse unsubstantiated requests for monitoring, respecting the privacy of the players.

4. The player may file a criminal claim against the official. If he/she fails to prove his/her claim, the official will be punished for false accusation.

5.
   The player can withdraw the complaint from the player he/she is complaining about by requesting a penalty, except for penalties that damage the server such as bug usage, 3rd party software usage, if the complaint is requested to be withdrawn in cases that concern and disturb the person and cause damage, the penalty withdrawal is applied. The person who withdraws the complaint cannot complain about the same person, for the same reason, with the same evidence within 1 month.

If you think that the **punishment are unfair**, a Penalty Appeal is required. You can appeal by creating a support request on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/superdc).

# Punishment Appeal Rules

* If the player's penalty has been in progress for more than 45 minutes, the player cannot appeal the penalty.

* The player cannot appeal a penalty without evidence, witnesses are not evidence.

* If the player behaves in an aggressive, threatening and accusatory manner towards the official dealing with him/her during the penalty appeal, the official has the right to reject the penalty appeal.

* The player cannot appeal the penalty by claiming that he or she “did not know” the offense.

* The player must NEVER leave the game when called for a cheat check. If he/she leaves the game, he/she will be banned for “Fleeing the cheat check”. After a player is banned, he/she can request control within 3 minutes. Players who do not request a check within 3 minutes will be DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTION if they request a check after the time limit.

* The Staff may refuse the player's request to find out the reason for the penalties not applied to him.

<Warning>
  Except for the rules for appealing penalties set out here, no appeal of any penalty is valid.
